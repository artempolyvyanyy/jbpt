== Untanglings: A Novel Approach to Behavioral Analysis of Process Models ==

===Implementation===

Implementations of the baseline and reduction-based algorithms for computing representative untanglings of net systems are published in 
`org.jbpt.petri.untangling.*` package of the _jbpt_ project.

===Experiment===

An experiment on the reduction-based construction of representative untanglings of net systems can be downloaded [https://code.google.com/p/jbpt/downloads/detail?name=UntanglingsExperiment.zip here].
